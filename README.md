# Prediction of Customer Subscription for a Term Deposit

A simple classification problem is solved using machine learning technologies in order to predict if a client is in favour of subscribing to a term deposit based on census data.

The following models were implemented for the project:
  1. Neural Network Model
  2. Random Forest Classification

The random forest classification model was proved to be the most efficient model among the two models implemented with an accuracy rate of 0.9468.
